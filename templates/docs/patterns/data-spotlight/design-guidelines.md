## Usage

The data spotlight pattern highlights key numbers and statistics in a visually prominent way. It consists of a required highlight rule, stat, and headline, with optional description and link. This pattern can contain between 2 - 4 blocks. Stats should contain numbers (maximum 10 characters) with short headlines (maximum 20 characters).

### When to use

- To draw attention to important data points or achievements
- To support a story with clear, easy-to-digest numbers
- To summarize key metrics in a simple and consistent layout

### When not to use

- When the content is descriptive text rather than numeric data, please use Text spotlight instead
- When you have fewer than 2 or more than 4 stats
- When detailed explanations are required instead of concise highlights

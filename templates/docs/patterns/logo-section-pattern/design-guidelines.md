## Usage

The logo section highlights the logo as the primary content. It is typically paired with a muted heading, an optional description, and a CTA block. This pattern is used to emphasize brand identity or partner associations within a page.

### When to use

In cases where the logo block functions as the main content, with all other elements acting as supporting content

### When not to use

1. When images, lists, or other content need to be included, use the [Basic section](/docs/patterns/basic-section) instead
2. If logos need to be linked, use the linked logo section instead
